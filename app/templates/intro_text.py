    "chart_intro_1": "<p>On the map and in the filters above is essentially raw data: Every company that can ship wine directly to customers in the state, as registered with the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.</p><p>It's a novel concept in the commonwealth. It's only been legal since August 2016. <a href=\"http://www.lcb.pa.gov/Legal/Documents/003492.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The rules are a little weird</a>.</p><p>The way the PLCB <a href=\"http://www.lcbapps.lcb.state.pa.us/webapp/Retail/Direct_Shippers_list.asp\" target=\"_blank\">presents this data</a> is, shall we say, unhelpful. There's no way to sort it or make sense of it or, really, dig into it at all.</p>Hence <a class=\"grape-ape\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8G5gSP64D4\">Grape</a> <a class=\"grape-ape\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylloxera\">Aphid</a>. Scraped PLCB data gets cleaned up and added to and made more accessible and here we are.</p>",
    "chart_intro_2": "<p>Beyond the raw data, all place by place and one by one, sometimes the broader set has useful things to say. One thing that becomes clear fairly quickly is these are not all little wineries representing themselves.</p><p>There are more than a few companies in this data that represent or own a number of wineries and can ship those products to you. Pennsylvania doesn't give us any way to to know which ones or what their inventory is. The state doesn't point us to their websites.</p><p>One example is <a href=\"http://dvwinepartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Distinguished Vinyards & Wine Partners</a> which represents a handful of wineries in Oregon, California and Australia. In the PLCB's data it shows up as Lion Nathan USA, an old corporate name, at an address in Oregon not far from wine country, an hour or so from Portland. And that's it.</p><p>Even with the data in hand, there's so much more to explore.</p>"
