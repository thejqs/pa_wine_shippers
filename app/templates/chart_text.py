    "chart1_1": "As we begin to look inside the data, maybe it isn't a surprise that most of these businesses are based in California.",
    "chart1_2": "There is no close second.",
    "chart1_3": "It's only become more pronounced over time. Consider June 2017. Even though there are only a handful more direct shippers now than there were then, a greater proportion are from California. And those from Pennsylvania have receded.",
    "chart2": "The counties with the most show how concentrated they can be. The top counties are in California, then Oregon, then Washington, with New York also in the picture. Pennsylvania -- the state with the second-most direct-wine-shippers -- consistently shows up for the first time at or near the bottom of the top 15 counties.",
    "chart3": "Here's where things start to get a little more revealing. Some of the wine-shippers use the same addresses -- at times because it's an office park home to a few of them, or because the same business handles a number of different wineries.",
    "chart4": "Where that's visible even more is in the contact email addresses. Several are represented at least a dozen times."
